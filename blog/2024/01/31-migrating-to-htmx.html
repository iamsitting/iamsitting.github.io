        <p>Let me tell you a story about poor design choice and how a small library saved a project.</p>
        <h2 id="in-the-beginning" tabindex="-1">In the beginnning... <a class="header-anchor"
                href="#in-the-beginning">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>There was a project that had gotten old, the VM could not be upgraded, and the project needed to be rewritten
            from scratch.</p>
        <p>So I had a lot of spare time and joined in on this effort having already done a rewrite in Python. I had
            gained a good amount of experience and had a solid understanding of basic web and http architecture along
            with Linux and NGINX configuration. However, because of business requirements I had to work in the Microsoft
            ecosystem. It was 2019 and luckily for me, .NET Core was just coming out.</p>
        <p>I was excited to learn a new language and a new framework and to have full control in the design and
            architecture of this application. In my previous Python rewrite, we were using Django, React, Bootstrap 3,
            and jQuery. It was an utter mess. Django was great, but React was traumatizing. That said, the best part of
            the application was the one page that used React.</p>
        <h2 id="the-mistake" tabindex="-1">The Mistake <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-mistake">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>In an attempt to not repeat this mistake, I decided I would limit the amount of MVC architecture and go full
            blow JSON API + SPA architecture. I did this for a couple of reasons:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Decoupling: I wanted everything to be decoupled. The database from the backend API. The backend API from
                the SPA. My hope was that it would be easier to grow the team if we could find specialist: e.g. a
                frontend developer vs a backend developer.</li>
            <li>Testing: Because of the decoupled architecture, my thought was that it would also be easier to run
                automated tests at each layer of the application.</li>
            <li>Javascript: I figured more people know javascript than C#, so we're more likely to find javascript
                developers than C# developers. I chose Vue as our framework since it seemed the easiest to learn.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>And here were my mistakes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Thinking an SPA is decoupled. It's not. An SPA may be an application level decoupling, but it's not
                architecturally. The client must know about
                the API. So the code is decoupled, but not the architecture. This meant that every time we changed our
                models or an API, we had to test both the API and the client.</li>
            <li>Thinking testing is easy. It's not. Writing test cases is hard, but maintaining them is even harder,
                especially
                as requirements change. Lastly, we didn't have the team to support a test infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Thinking an SPA framework is just javascript. This is also not true. Knowing an SPA framework requires
                and understanding of HTTP
                architecture, state management, templating, routing, etc. The javascript (or typescript in our case) was
                easy, but the framework was difficult to pick up. And this was the nail in the coffin. As the project
                grew, the client application became unmanageable.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="the-solution" tabindex="-1">The Solution <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-solution">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>The solution was switching to a Hypermedia Driven Application. I had heard about HTMX and read several of the
            essays. As I read through the essays, it felt like the author(s) were writing about my experience.</p>
        <p>I tried out HTMX in a few small applications and saw the appeal. But if I was going to invest time and effort
            into migrating my code base from a thick client to a think client, I wanted to know what I was getting
            myself into.</p>
        <p>So I read the book <a href="https://hypermedia.systems">Hypermedia Systems</a>, and was completely sold on
            this idea. I started by migrating parts of my codebase. I had a Vertical Slice Architecture that allowed me
            to migrate part of my application to HTMX while not interfering with the other features.</p>
        <p>Some of the improvements I have seen are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Finding and fixing bugs is faster. I don't have to dig through the stack and through layers of state. I
                know exactly where my was.</li>
            <li>Error handling was simpler. My error handling and state were all in one location. No more backend AND
                frontend validation.</li>
            <li>Learnability. It was faster to onboard new developers to HTMX and C# then it was to onboard javascript
                developers to an SPA.</li>
            <li>Less code. Although, I haven't completely deprecated the Web API + SPA code, the amount of code I have
                to look at is signifanctly less 35 to 40% less.</li>
        </ul>
