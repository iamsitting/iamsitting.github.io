        </ul>

        <p>It's not a typo. I really do mean <strong>Do</strong> Repeat Yourself. There is a common software development
            principle known as DRY (don't repeat yourself). It clearly has its merits, however, this principle can be
            one of the greatest mistakes in software development, especially for the unexperienced.</p>

        <p>The DRY principle is the idea that code should not be repeated. The reasons I've heard before are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Less code, means it's easier to maintain and refactor.</li>
            <li>Less code, means it's easier to read and fix.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These reasons are absolutely valid and there is nothing wrong with the DRY principle. What's wrong is how
            it's implemented. Often, reducing code means abstracting code. And here lies the problem: the wrong
            abstraction. I a piece of behavior is improperly abstracted you will get:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>More code... eventually. At first, there will be less code, but as requirements change, the abstraction
                will need to cover more cases than originally intended and making it more difficult to maintain.</li>
            <li>Because a new layer of abstraction was introduced, a developer has to learn both the abstraction and
                that which was abstracted. Without the proper documentation, this will be more difficult to read and
                more difficult to fix.</li>
            <li>Because of the prior two problems, you will be forced to think of solutions to problems that do not
                exist (and may never exist). Therefore, at some point, you will spend time fixing problems that do not
                exist and in doing so, perhaps even introduce problems that would not exist otherwise.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some general rules I have picked up:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Repeat yourself up to 5 times. Prematurely abstracting adds unnecessary complexity. I am okay
                refactoring the same code in 5 files, or adding the same
                argument to the same 5 functions. Any more than that and it may be time to consider a layer of
                abstraction.</li>
            <li>No more than 1 layer of abstraction. Once we open up that can of worms, when will it end. For me it's
                once. What do I mean by that?. Suppose I created an abstract class that contains properties that I want
                all of my entities to share: <code>BaseEntity</code>. Therefore, my <code>BaseEntity</code> class will
                only have 1 level inheritance. There will be no <code>BaseEntity</code> -> <code>PersonEntity</code> ->
                <code>Patient</code>. At this point, I am likely using the wrong abstraction for what I am trying to
                accomplish.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You might still not be sold. Understandable. Here are some of the experiences that helped me come to this:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA). The first time I used this kind of architecture was actually in
                Django. Django has this idea of modules, where you can organize your MVC files in modules. ASP.NET has
                the concept of Areas or Razor Pages that facilitate this kind of archtitecture. Angular also facilitates
                this kind of architecture. I worked on a project that was an domain-driven/onion-layered architecture.
                When I migrated it to VSA, there was significantly less code, less abstraction, and less complexity. A
                little more repition, sure. Less testable? The UI was already being manually tested. Anything below the
                application layer was still onion-layered and just as testable.
            </li>
            <li>Locality of Behavior. One of my favorite things about Angular was the separation of concerns that was
                forced on me. CSS, HTML, and JS code were literally in separate files. Then I learned Vue, and loved it
                more since, CSS, HTML, and JS were still separated, but all in one file. There was something convenient
                and intuitive knowing that all my concerns were in one place. After moving over a project to HTMX and
                reducing the amount of javascript to zero, I started inlining javascript and css. Did I have to write
                <code>class="uk-button uk-buttom-small uk-button-primary"</code> over and over again? Sure. But it
                worked. What if I need to migrate from UIKit to Tailwind. It's unlikely. And there are so many other
                problems, that I am not going to try to fix a problem that will likely never come.
            </li>
            <li>Go. I started learning Go, and love going back to the ideas of structs. Most modern programming
                languages offer the Class construct as programming feature. It's "feature" is that it can be inherited.
                This easily one of the most abused language features I have ever seen. Go's structs are non-inheritable.
                Therefore you are forced to think away from inheritance. You may ask what's the problem with
                inheritance. The problem is not with inheritance. The problem is with coupling. I develop in C# which
                has classes. This is not about programming languages or classes or even about inheritance. It's about unnecessary coupling, especially in premature abstraction.</li>
