        <p>I get a lot of questions of how I ended up being a software developer - so I figured I'd take the time to go
            into detail a little. I'm hoping this article can highlight some of the important things that every
            <em>decent</em> software developer needs.
        </p>
        <p> I am by no means a 10x developer or a seasoned veteran. But I've worked with good developers. I've worked
            with bad ones. Young and old. CS degree devs and bootcamp devs.</p>

        <h2 id="interest" tabindex="-1">Interest <a class="header-anchor" href="#interest">#</a></h2>
        <p>The first line of code I ever wrote was in 10th grade. I wrote a "hello, world!" program in Java on Netbeans.
            I
            was
            easily the best or second best in my class and it was recognized. However, I'll admit, it was not that
            interesting.</p>
        <p>I saw programming as just a tool. It was a hard tool. It's nice, but not for me.</p>

        <p>So here's the first thing: <strong>interest</strong>. Software, programming, computer science concepts
            have
            to be interesting. Especially early on. It can't just be about the product. In the real world, what
            counts
            is the product. This is what brings in the money. But for becoming a software developer there has to
            be an
            interest in the means as much as the end. And early on, the means may actually be more important than the
            end.
        </p>

        <p>I didn't start getting interested in software development until 2017 when I started working on a Django
            application. It took me a week to get my setup work (it took some two week!). Then I started working on
            little things to improve that process. After a year, new devs were getting started in a few hours.
            
        </p>

        <h2 id="exposure" tabindex="-1">Exposure <a class="header-anchor" href="#exposure">#</a></h2>
        <p>When I went to college, I ended up studying Electrical Engineering with hopes of designing embedded devices.
            I knew there would be a lot math, which I was good at. I knew there would be a lot of physics, which I
            liked. But I didn't know there would be a lot of progamming.</p>
        <p>Honestly, if it wasn't for that introductional computer science class in high school, I would have struggled.
            But having even a little exposure, gave me a leg up.</p>
        <p>Early on in my college career, I had to learn C++, Assembly, Verilog, C, and Matlab. But again, these were
            all just tools, a means to end. And I only cared about the end.</p>
        <p>So here's the next point: <em>exposure</em>. To be a good software developer, just just need to see a lot of
            code. You need to write a lot of it. You don't have to understand everything, but you need to see what code
            looks like. Forget about good code or bad code.</p>
        <p>All those languages, I've mentioned, I never got good at any of them. Other than C, it would take me a about
            6 months to be proficient at any of them. The point is, I saw lot of code and I wrote a lot of it.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h2 id="solve" tabindex="-1">Solve a Problem <a class="header-anchor" href="#solve">#</a></h2>
        <p>In college, I decided to take an Android development class. Back then, it was a novelty to have such a class.
            Little, that I know that would be the turnoing point of my career.</p>
