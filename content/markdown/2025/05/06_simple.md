I've been on paternity leave recently, and between newborn naps and toddler playtime, I've finally had a little more space to read. I'm working through Extreme Ownership as part of a book club at BuildWitt and one principle in particular has stuck with me: "Simple."

Jocko Willink explains that if a plan or message isn't simple, it won't be understood, and if it's not understood, it won't be executed, especially under pressure.

That makes perfect sense in high-stakes environments like the military. But it also made me wonder: How does this apply to software? Because let's face it, software gets complex fast, especially as teams grow and systems scale.

Here's where I landed:

Simple doesn't mean simplistic. In engineering, "simple" often means clear. Clear boundaries between services. Clear naming. Clear documentation. Clear expectations between teammates.

Yes, some complexity is necessary. But before introducing it, I've found it helpful to ask:

- What problem is this really solving?
- Will this be obvious to someone joining the team six months from now?
- Can this be explained in a few sentences without whiteboarding the whole system?
- Are we adding flexibility for a real use case, or just in case?

And when complexity is justified, I've learned that simplicity still matters, especially in how we communicate it. Whether it's a good diagram, a well-structured doc, or a thoughtful conversation, simplicity shows up in how we lead.

It's a good reminder: clarity isn't just a design goal, it's a leadership habit.
