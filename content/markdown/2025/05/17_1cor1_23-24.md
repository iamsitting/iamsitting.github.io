# Christ Crucified: The Power and Wisdom of God in Our Experience

In 1 Corinthians 1:23–24, Paul makes a bold and surprising claim:

> “We preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, **Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God**.”

Let that sink in. The cross—the very symbol of weakness, shame, and apparent defeat—is God’s ultimate display of **power** and **wisdom**.

To the religious mind, it’s offensive.  
To the intellectual mind, it’s foolish.  
But to those who have come to know Christ personally, it’s everything.

We don’t just admire the cross. We **live** by it.

## When Power Looks Like Weakness

Let’s talk about **power**.

We often feel powerless. Powerless against a sinful habit we keep falling into. Powerless in a moment of conflict when our temper flares up again. Powerless when our mind is flooded with anxiety and we don’t know how to push through. Or maybe it's subtler—feeling helpless to love someone we just don’t click with, or to overcome our laziness when we know we should pray or serve.

In those moments, we instinctively try harder. We grit our teeth. We make vows. And often... we fail again.

But **Romans 6:6** tells us something radical:

> “Our old man has been crucified with Him, in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves.”

The cross isn’t just a historical event—it’s **our spiritual reality**. The part of us that keeps falling short—our old man—was dealt with at the cross. That means real power isn’t about trying harder. It’s about recognizing that **Christ already overcame**, and learning to live by the One who now lives in us.

That’s what **Galatians 2:20** means:

> “I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me…”

We experience God's power when we stop relying on ourselves and begin depending on Christ in us. This doesn’t look dramatic. It may be as simple as stopping in the middle of an argument and inwardly saying, *“Lord, I can’t. But You can.”*

## When Wisdom Isn’t What We Expect

Now let’s consider **wisdom**.

We usually think of wisdom as knowing the right answer, making the smart choice, or avoiding mistakes. But God’s wisdom is different—it’s not primarily about solving problems, but about **producing a person**.

In **1 Corinthians 1:30**, Paul writes:

> “But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God: both **righteousness and sanctification and redemption**.”

Notice—Christ doesn't just give us wisdom. He **is** our wisdom. And that wisdom unfolds as God's full salvation:

- **Righteousness** in our spirit — when we were born again and justified.  
- **Sanctification** in our soul — as we are transformed day by day.  
- **Redemption** in our body — when we are glorified at Christ’s return.

This is wisdom not just for theology books—it’s wisdom for your Tuesday morning when you’re overwhelmed at work. It’s wisdom for your relationships, your parenting, your reactions. It’s wisdom for every time you think, *“I should know better,”* but realize you still fall short.

Wisdom, in God’s eyes, isn’t about perfection. It’s about **participation**—letting Christ live through us in the everyday.

## So What Does This Mean For Us?

The cross shows us a new way to live. Not by **self-effort**, but by **union**. Not by being clever or strong, but by being **dependent**.

Here’s the irony: the cross looks like loss, but it’s gain. It feels like death, but it brings life.

So next time you feel defeated—by sin, by pressure, by weakness—remember: the answer isn’t to try harder. The answer is to turn inwardly to Christ. To let His death work in your self-life, and His life rise in you afresh.

And when you’re confused, unsure of what to do or who to be—remember: Christ is your wisdom. He’s in you to walk you through every step, not always with explanations, but with presence.

## TL;DR

**Christ crucified is not a past event to admire—it’s a present reality to live.**  
- As **God’s power**, the cross delivers us from sin, self, and the world.  
- As **God’s wisdom**, the cross brings us into Christ as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.  

It may look weak and foolish—but in God’s kingdom, **that’s the very path to life**.
