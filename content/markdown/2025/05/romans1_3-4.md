# The Seed of David Becoming the Son of God

In Romans 1:3–4, Paul introduces Jesus Christ with two profound titles:  
He is the **Seed of David according to the flesh**, and the **Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead**.

This introduction reveals Christ's **two natures**:

- As the **Seed of David**, He is a genuine man—born of a woman, descended from David, possessing the human nature God created in Adam. This nature was **untainted by sin**.
- As the **Son of God**, He is divine—eternally begotten of the Father, possessing God's life and nature.

Yet what is striking is Paul’s choice of the word **“designated”** (or "marked out"):  
He writes that this Jesus, who came from David’s line, was **designated Son of God in power… out of the resurrection of the dead**.

Wait—wasn’t Jesus always the Son of God?

Yes. According to John 3:16, He is the **only begotten Son**, given to the world. He was God’s Son **before** the resurrection. But Paul is not speaking of His **eternal status**, but rather of something that happened **through resurrection**.

To understand this, we need to read **Acts 13:33**, where Paul applies **Psalm 2** to Jesus’ resurrection:

> “You are My Son; today I have begotten You.”

Paul interprets the **“today”** as the day of **resurrection**.  
In other words, Jesus’ resurrection was a kind of **begetting**—a public designation, even an *uplifting*, of His humanity.

Though His humanity was sinless and perfect, it was not yet **glorified**. Through death and resurrection, God uplifted that humanity—uniting it fully with divinity in glory. This is why Paul says He was *designated Son of God in power*. What God had sought in Adam, He finally gained in Christ—God and man joined **not just in person**, but in **process and result**.

This is confirmed in **Hebrews 2:10** and **6:20**—Jesus is now the **Forerunner**, leading **many sons into glory**. This is not just leadership by authority, but by **pattern** and **participation**.

In **Romans 8:29**, Paul calls Him the **Firstborn among many brothers**.  
He is no longer the only begotten—He’s the **Firstborn**.  
That implies there are others.

Who are they?

According to **1 Peter 1:3**, *“God… has regenerated us… through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.”*

His resurrection was both His **designation** and our **regeneration**.

Now, we too are on the same path. We are being **conformed to His image** (Rom. 8:29).  
This is the essence of the Christian life: not just to believe in Christ, but to **become like Christ**.

So when we pray, when we worship, when we serve—we are not just performing Christian activity.  
We are participating in a process:  
We are being conformed to the One who was designated Son of God in power.

## TL;DR

- Jesus Christ is both **the Seed of David** (a genuine man) and **the Son of God** (divine).
- Though always the Son, He was **designated Son of God in power** through **resurrection**—His perfect humanity was uplifted and glorified.
- That resurrection was also **our regeneration** (1 Peter 1:3).
- Now He is the **Firstborn among many brothers** (Rom. 8:29)—and we are being **conformed to His image**.
- The Christian life is not just about doing things for God; it’s about being **transformed into the image of the resurrected, designated Son of God**.
- This gives meaning to everything we do as believers.
