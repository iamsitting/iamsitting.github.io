# The One New Man: God's New Humanity in Christ

> “...You have put on the new man, who is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him... where there cannot be Greek and Jew... but Christ is all and in all.”  
> — *Colossians 3:10–11*

When Paul says “new man” in Colossians, many English translations render it “new self.” But in Greek, the word isn’t *autos* (self) — it’s **anthrōpos** — *man* or *humanity*.

Paul isn’t just speaking of inward renewal — he’s speaking of a new, shared identity.  
He’s pointing to a **corporate person**, a **new humanity** created by God in Christ.

## Where Was the New Man Created?

Paul tells us in **Ephesians 2:15**:  
> “...that He might create the two in Himself into one new man...”

This new man was not formed over time — he was **created**.  
Created **on the cross**, when Christ:
- Ended the **old creation**
- Abolished the **ordinances** that divided humanity
- Crucified the **flesh** (Romans 6:6)
- Condemned the **world** (Galatians 6:14)

In His death, Christ didn’t just remove sin — He cleared the ground for something new.

And in His resurrection, He became the Head of a **new race**, the **Second Man** (1 Corinthians 15:47), the beginning of a **new creation**.

## God's Original Purpose: A Corporate Man

In **Genesis 1:26**, God said:  
> “Let Us make man in Our image... and let them have dominion.”

Even though “man” is singular, the next phrase — “let *them* have dominion” — reveals a **corporate intention**.

God wasn’t merely creating Adam as an individual. He was initiating His purpose: to express Himself and represent His authority **through a corporate man**.

Adam failed. But in Christ — the Second Man — God’s purpose resumes and will be fulfilled.

## The Church as the New Man

In **Colossians 3**, Paul tells us to “put on the new man.”  
This new man is **Christ expressed corporately** — in and through the church.

This is not just another way of describing the church — it is the **highest revelation** of what the church is. And it is also the **highest standard** of relationship among believers.

Let’s compare:

- The church as a **congregation** implies shared space or gathering.
- The church as the **household of God** implies relational closeness — we’re family.
- The church as the **Body of Christ** implies coordination, supply, and mutual functioning.
- But the church as the **one new man**?  
  It implies **one person**.

One mouth. One mind. One will. One expression.  
**Not many individuals — but Christ, who is all and in all.**

In this new man, there is no room for our natural distinctions, identities, preferences, or positions.  
There is only Christ.

## Why This Matters

This vision is not just theological — it’s deeply practical.

The **one new man** doesn’t allow us to stay comfortable in our culture, personality, or background.  
It requires us to let go of everything not **in Christ** — because in this man, **Christ is all**.

This is why the one new man matters:
- It reveals the **highest goal** of the church — not just to function, or relate, or gather, but to **be one person** in Christ.
- It demands the **highest standard** of living — not just loving each other, but allowing Christ to live through all.
- It shows us that God’s purpose is not simply to save individuals, but to create **a new humanity** that fulfills Genesis 1:26 — expressing God and representing Him on the earth.

This is the church God is after.  
This is the church the cross produced.  
This is the church we are called to put on.

## Final Word

The one new man is not just an ideal — it’s a creation.

It was created at the cross, raised in resurrection, and is now being renewed day by day — until Christ is expressed fully in His Body.

Let us therefore put on this new man — not only as individuals growing in Christ, but as a people becoming **Christ together**.
