# AI in Software Engineering: The Technical Debt Mortgage

The AI debate in software engineering has become increasingly polarized. On one side, we hear dramatic predictions about AI replacing developers entirely. On the other, there's fierce resistance, with critics dismissing AI as nothing more than a technical debt generator. After recent hands-on experience, I've come to see it differently: AI is like a mortgage in your technical toolkit – it has its place when used strategically.

## The Mess We Inherit

Recently, I inherited a codebase that probably looks familiar to many of you. You know the type – the kind that makes you want to reach for a strong coffee and a long weekend. It had all the hallmarks of code written without long-term maintenance in mind: cron jobs that failed silently, processes that died without warning, and zero visibility into what was actually happening. The kind of system that keeps you up at night wondering if everything will still be running in the morning.

When something failed, it was nearly impossible to tell what went wrong or if it had failed at all. The system had been running on hope and prayer for months, with no monitoring, no alerting, and no way to trace failures back to their root causes. It was a perfect storm of technical debt that had accumulated over years of "quick fixes" and "temporary solutions."

## The Business Reality

Everyone says "just rebuild it from scratch" – but try telling that to the business when critical systems are down and customers are waiting. You can't just hit pause on revenue while you craft the perfect solution. This is where the mortgage analogy becomes particularly relevant.

In many organizations, especially those with legacy systems, there's a constant tension between the need for immediate functionality and the desire for long-term architectural excellence. The business needs the system to work today, not in six months when you've finished a complete rewrite.

## Strategic Borrowing with AI

So I did what any desperate engineer does: I borrowed time. But this time, I borrowed it from AI. In a few frantic hours, it spit out monitoring dashboards and some tactical refactoring. Not perfect, but enough to give us breathing room. Enough to see what was actually breaking and why.

The AI-generated solution included:
- A basic monitoring dashboard that tracked key system metrics
- Simpler retry mechanisms for failed processes
- Basic logging improvements that made debugging possible

Was it the perfect, final solution? No. But like a well-planned mortgage, it was low-interest technical debt that bought us the space we needed to do things right.

## The Mortgage Metaphor

It's like taking out a mortgage when you need a house now, not in 20 years. The debt isn't the problem – it's the unplanned, high-interest kind that kills you. Used strategically, with the right tools (including AI), it can buy you the space you need to do things right.

Just as a mortgage helps you acquire a house when you don't have the full cash amount, strategic technical debt can help you bridge the gap between immediate needs and long-term solutions. The key is being intentional about it.

## The Strategic Compromise

Here's why this approach worked:
- The AI-assisted solution was internal-facing – no customer-facing code was compromised
- It provided immediate visibility into our system's problems
- Most importantly, it bought us the time needed to properly engineer a robust solution
- The "debt" was structured and manageable, not the chaotic accumulation of quick fixes

## Engineering Wisdom: Know When to Borrow

The system is still a mess, but now it's a mess we can see and control. And that's the first step toward something better.

The real engineering wisdom isn't in always building everything from scratch or in completely avoiding technical debt. It's in knowing when and how to strategically use the tools at your disposal – including AI.

We're still working on that comprehensive reengineering project, but now we're doing it with better monitoring, clearer insights, and without the pressure of flying blind. We've left the quick patches to AI while focusing our engineering expertise on building the sustainable, long-term solution.

## The Tool, Not the Replacement

The way I see it, AI is just another engineering tool. This one happens to be very good at lending time when you need it most.

In the end, AI isn't replacing software engineers – it's becoming another tool in our belt. Like a mortgage, it's neither inherently good nor bad. It's all about how you use it. And sometimes, the smartest move isn't to build everything from scratch, but to know when to borrow strategically.

Borrow responsibly.
