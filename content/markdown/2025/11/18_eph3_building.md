# Two Buildings & Two Groups of Builders

In Ephesians 3 and 4, Paul presents us with a vision of Christian life that is both deeply personal and profoundly corporate. He shows us two complementary "buildings" — one that happens inwardly, and one that happens outwardly. Together, they describe the full Christian experience.

But buildings don't build themselves. Paul also shows us two groups of "builders" — those who lay foundations through revelation, and those who build together through grace.

This isn't just theology. This is how Christ works in us and among us.

## I. Two Buildings

Paul presents two complementary "buildings" in Ephesians — one inward (a building "down") and one outward (a "building up"). Together they describe the full Christian experience.

### 1. Christ Making His Home in the Heart (Eph. 3:17–19)

This is the personal building — what Christ builds in you.

> "That Christ may make His home (*kataoikeo*) in your hearts through faith…"

This building includes:

- **Inward formation** — Christ settling into every "room" of our inner being
- **Rooted and grounded in love** — stability and nourishment
- **Experiential knowing** — "to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge"
- **Inner fullness** — "filled unto all the fullness of God"

This is spiritual construction happening privately, personally, and inwardly.

Before the church can be built outwardly, Christ must build Himself inwardly.

This is the first building — the home Christ makes in the believer.

### 2. The Building Up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12–16)

This is the corporate building — what Christ builds among us.

> "...for the building up of the Body of Christ… until we all arrive at the fullness of Christ."

This building includes:

- **Unity of the faith**
- **Corporate knowledge of Christ**
- **A full-grown Body**
- **Every joint supplying**
- **The Body building itself up in love**

This is Christ expressed in community, fellowship, and mutual care.

This is the second building — the church built up in love.

## II. Two Builders

How do these two buildings actually take place?

Paul presents two groups of "builders" — both necessary, both intentional.

### 1. The Gifted Ones — Apostles and Prophets (Eph. 3:5; 4:11)

These are the foundational givers and initiators of revelation.

- In chapter 3 they receive the mystery of Christ first ("revealed to His holy apostles and prophets").
- In chapter 4 they are given as gifts to the church ("He gave some as apostles, some as prophets…").

Their function:

- **Open the revelation of Christ**
- **Lay spiritual foundations**
- **Equip others with what they see**

They are not an elite class; Paul calls himself:

> "Less than the least of all saints." (3:8)

Their role is foundational, not superior.

These are the first builders — those who equip by revelation.

---

### 2. The Perfected Ones — All the Saints (Eph. 4:7, 12, 16)

Every believer is a builder. Every believer receives:

> "...grace… to each one according to the measure of Christ." (4:7)

The gifted ones equip the saints so that the saints:

- **minister**
- **supply**
- **grow**
- **function**
- **build up the Body**

The building of the church is not done *for* the saints but *by* the saints.

Paul's vision is a church where:

- **every believer supplies a portion**
- **every believer contributes to growth**
- **every believer is essential**
- **every believer participates in Christ's expression**
- **the Body builds itself up in love**

These are the second builders — the perfected saints.

## III. The Flow of Building

Here's how it all works together:

**Christ builds Himself into us** (ch. 3).  
**Christ builds us into His Body** (ch. 4).

**Apostles/prophets lay the foundation** by revelation.  
**Saints grow, function, and build together** by grace.

This is not a hierarchy. It's a flow. The gifted ones receive and give. The perfected ones receive and build. Both are essential. Both are needed.

---

## Why This Matters

This vision matters because it shows us:

1. **The personal foundation must come first.** Before we can build together, Christ must build in us. Before we can supply others, we must be supplied by Christ.

2. **Every believer is essential.** The building of the church is not the work of a few gifted leaders. It's the work of every saint, each contributing their portion of Christ.

3. **The goal is corporate expression.** Christ's purpose is not just individual transformation, but a Body that expresses Him fully — a church built up in love until we all arrive at the fullness of Christ.

4. **Both builders are needed.** We need those who receive revelation and lay foundations. We also need every saint functioning, supplying, and building. One without the other is incomplete.

---

## Final Word

Two buildings. Two builders. One Christ.

The building work of Christ is both personal and corporate. It requires both those who equip by revelation and those who build by grace.

Let us therefore allow Christ to make His home in our hearts — that we might be rooted and grounded in love, filled with all the fullness of God.

And let us build together — each one supplying, each one functioning, each one essential — until we all arrive at the fullness of Christ.

This is the church God is building.  
This is the building work we are called to.
