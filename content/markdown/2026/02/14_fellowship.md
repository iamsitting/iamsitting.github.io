# Fellowship: Vertical and Horizontal in the Spirit

In 1 John 1:6–7, we encounter a passage that most Christians can immediately affirm:

> "If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth; but if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin."

Notice how fellowship is mentioned twice here: **fellowship with Him** and **fellowship with one another**. 

This gives us a two-dimensional picture of fellowship—what we might call **vertical** (with God) and **horizontal** (with other believers). No controversy here. Most Christians would nod along: yes, we need fellowship with God *and* fellowship with the body of Christ.

But here's where it gets interesting: **What exactly *is* fellowship in this context?**

## What Is Fellowship?

The word "fellowship" suggests joint participation—something shared together. In Greek, the word is *koinonia*, which carries the idea of communion, partnership, or sharing in common.

But to truly understand what fellowship means, we need to look at another key verse: **2 Corinthians 13:14**.

> "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with all of you."

Here's a pattern we should notice:
- **Christ** is grace
- **God (the Father)** is love  
- **The Holy Spirit** is... fellowship

Now, we readily accept that Christ embodies grace. We have no problem saying "God is love" (see 1 John 4:8). But can we also accept that **the Spirit *is* fellowship**?

If we can, then we unlock something crucial: **Fellowship—both with God and with one another—is entirely a matter of the Spirit.**

## Fellowship with God: Obviously the Spirit

When it comes to our relationship with God, this is fairly obvious. We don't fellowship with God in the natural realm—we don't see Him, touch Him, or hear His audible voice most of the time. Our fellowship with God happens in the spirit. **John 4:24** confirms this:

> "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness."

So when we pray, when we worship, when we sense God's presence or respond to His leading—that's the Holy Spirit mediating our fellowship with the Father and the Son.

No debate there.

## Fellowship with One Another: Where It Gets Practical

But what about our contact with **one another**?

This is where the rubber meets the road. Is every gathering of Christians automatically "fellowship"? If a group of believers meets to carry out a spiritual activity—Bible study, worship, outreach—does that qualify as fellowship?

**Well, that depends.**

Here's the real question: **Are we contacting one another through the Spirit?**

Just as fellowship with God requires being in the Spirit, so does fellowship with one another. You can be surrounded by Christians, sing songs together, even discuss Scripture, and yet not truly be in fellowship if the **Spirit isn't the medium** through which you're connecting.

Think about it practically:
- You can have a church service where everyone is physically present, but spiritually isolated.
- You can have a "fellowship meal" where no one is actually sharing anything of Christ with one another.
- You can even have a prayer meeting where people are saying words *at* each other instead of ministering Christ *to* one another.

True fellowship isn't primarily about being together in a room or engaging in religious activities. It's about **sharing Christ through the Spirit**. It's about the flow of the Spirit between believers as they give and receive from the supply of the Spirit in one another.

## The Test: Are We in the Spirit?

So here's the challenge: in our gatherings, in our conversations, in our interactions with other believers—**are we in the Spirit?**

- When we talk, are we ministering Christ or just exchanging opinions?
- When we pray together, are we touching the throne of grace or performing a ritual?
- When we "do life" together, are we bearing witness to the Spirit's reality or simply being social?

The vertical and horizontal dimensions of fellowship are inseparable because they share the same source: **the Holy Spirit**. Our fellowship with God is limited if we refuse to fellowship with His people. And our fellowship with one another is hindered unless we're both touching the same Spirit.

---

## Conclusion

Fellowship is of the Spirit. That means:
- It's not automatic just because Christians are in the same room.
- It's not a program or an event on the calendar.
- It requires that we live, move, and relate **in the Spirit**.

So the next time you gather with believers, ask yourself: *Am I here in the Spirit? Am I giving and receiving Christ? Is the Spirit flowing between us?*

That's what makes fellowship real—vertical and horizontal, all by the one Spirit.
