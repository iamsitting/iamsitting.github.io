# Some Key Habits of a Leader

I recently finished reading The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey, and it was eye-opening! These habits aren’t just theories—they’re practical principles that have reshaped how I approach both work and life.

A few habits that really hit home for me:

## Win/Win

Think Win/Win: As someone working with products, I’ve seen firsthand how prioritizing mutual success builds stronger relationships. When you aim for outcomes that benefit both customers and stakeholders, you create partnerships that last.

## First Understand, Then Be Understood

Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood: This one really changed how I handle conversations—especially tough ones. Listening with empathy has helped me uncover customer needs I might have missed and find clarity in complex team discussions.

## Synergize

Synergize: Collaboration isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a game changer. Some of the best solutions I’ve been part of didn’t come from me or any one person. They came from combining diverse perspectives across teams. It’s amazing what happens when you embrace creativity and trust in others’ expertise.

## Sharpen the Saw

Sharpen the Saw: Covey talks about renewal, and this resonated deeply. I’ve realized how critical it is to invest in personal growth—whether it’s through learning, rest, or even stepping back to reflect. Growth isn’t a sprint; it’s a marathon.


## Trust
For me, the biggest shift was embracing Covey’s concept of the “emotional bank account.” Every interaction—whether with customers, peers, or family—is a deposit or a withdrawal. Building trust, showing kindness, and keeping commitments aren’t just nice ideas; they’re the foundation of meaningful relationships.

These habits offer fresh remainders that tech is more than software—it’s about people. When we lead with empathy and collaboration, we don’t just deliver value; we create impact that lasts.
