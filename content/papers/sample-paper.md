# A Sample Research Paper

## Abstract

This is a sample research paper to demonstrate the new papers functionality. Papers are designed to be long-form content that is not searchable or navigable through the UI, but only accessible via direct URL.

## Introduction

The papers feature provides a way to publish standalone academic or research content that doesn't fit into the regular blog post structure. These papers:

- Are accessible only via direct URLs
- Use the same markdown format as blog posts
- Have the same layout and styling as posts
- Support all markdown features including code blocks
- Are not included in search or navigation

## Methodology

```javascript
// Example code block
function sampleFunction() {
    return "This demonstrates code highlighting in papers";
}
```

## Results

Papers support all the same markdown features as blog posts:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Lists
- Blockquotes
- Code blocks
- And more

> This is a sample blockquote to show formatting.

## Conclusion

This sample paper demonstrates that the papers functionality is working correctly. The paper can be accessed at `/papers/sample-paper` and uses the same beautiful layout as regular blog posts.
