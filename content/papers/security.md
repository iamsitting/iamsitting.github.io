# Once Saved, Always Saved—But Not Once Forgiven, Always Forgiven

## Abstract

This article presents the doctrine of Kingdom reward and discipline as a pastoral solution to the contentious debate over eternal security. Rather than choosing between "once saved, always saved" and conditional security, this framework distinguishes between salvation (eternally secure) and reward (conditionally earned), addressing both theological concerns and pastoral needs.

The Kingdom reward doctrine affirms that while salvation is received by faith alone and cannot be lost, believers' works will be evaluated at the judgment seat of Christ to determine their reward and participation in the millennial kingdom. This creates meaningful consequences for Christian living without threatening eternal security, resolving the motivational concerns often raised against eternal security while preserving the security of salvation.

The phrase "Once saved, always saved—but not once forgiven, always forgiven" encapsulates this framework. The first half affirms eternal security—salvation, once received through faith, cannot be lost. The second half acknowledges that believers require ongoing forgiveness for ongoing sin, as fellowship with God (though not union) can be disrupted by unconfessed sin.

This approach reframes biblical warnings traditionally used against eternal security as referring to loss of reward rather than loss of salvation. Passages about being "cut off," experiencing "outer darkness," or missing the "wedding feast" are interpreted as millennial kingdom exclusions rather than eternal damnation. The result is a system that takes seriously both God's grace in salvation and His justice in evaluation, providing believers with confident assurance while maintaining the gravity of Christian responsibility and the hope of eternal reward.

## Introduction

The goal of this article is to address one of the most contentious doctrines in Christianity: the eternal security of salvation—commonly referred to as "once saved, always saved." This article approaches the topic primarily from a pastoral perspective, focusing not merely on doctrinal correctness, but on the profound impact this doctrine has on Christian experience, assurance, and spiritual growth. The focus on this topic stems not from its centrality as a doctrine, but because it is one of the most logically exclusive. Unlike other theological debates that allow for degrees of nuance or synthesis, the question of salvation’s permanence presents a binary dilemma: either salvation, once granted, is secure—or it can be lost.

Consider debates such as predestination versus free will. While contentious, this discussion allows room for various nuanced positions—like compatibilism or limited libertarianism. Likewise, the debate over imputed versus infused righteousness features hybrid views that attempt to bridge elements of both. These are not strictly either/or. But contrast that with the question of Christ’s deity: Is Jesus God? That is binary. Either He is the eternal, omnipotent God, or He is not. And though heresies exist, the orthodox Christian faith holds firmly to the former.

The same binary structure applies to the question at hand: Can someone lose their salvation? The answer must be yes or no. There is no middle ground. And that’s what makes this doctrine particularly polarizing. While it may not rise to the level of an essential like the deity of Christ, it is nonetheless a critical question—one that shapes assurance, discipleship, and how we understand the nature of grace itself. This article approaches the doctrine with that attitude in mind: it is not essential for salvation, but it is essential for the believer's peace, growth, and spiritual well-being.

## Salvation by Faith, Not by Works

Before exploring the question of whether salvation can be lost, this analysis must first begin with common ground: that salvation is by faith, and by faith alone. This section is intended to affirm that foundation—that salvation is a free gift received through faith, not a reward earned by works.

While some theological systems assert that salvation is earned or kept through works, this article does not engage with those directly. That is a separate matter. Instead, this article assumes agreement with the historic Protestant conviction that salvation is received by grace through faith. This may also resonate with readers who affirm that salvation is initially received by faith but believe it must be maintained by works. For this section, however, the focus remains specifically on the receiving act—not the question of continuation.

Scripture teaches clearly that salvation comes by faith:

> “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.”  
> — *Ephesians 2:8–9*

To be saved, one must believe:

> “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved.”  
> — *Acts 16:31*

And what is received through that belief is not a wage or a reward, but a gift:

> “Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due. But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.”  
> — *Romans 4:4–5*

Salvation is nothing less than eternal life—the very Zoe life of God:
> "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life."
> — *John 3:16*

> “God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life…”  
> — *1 John 5:11–12*

> “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life.”  
> — *John 6:47*

### Justification and Regeneration

When a person believes in Christ as Savior, that faith apprehends Him, and the result is twofold:

- **Justification**: being declared righteous before God  
  > “Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.”  
  > — *Romans 5:1*

- **Regeneration**: being born again by the life of God  
  > “Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God.”  
  > — *1 John 5:1*

  > “He saved us… by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit.”  
  > — *Titus 3:5*

  > “Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes Him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment but has passed from death to life.”  
  > — *John 5:24*

Therefore, this investigation of the security or insecurity of salvation proceeds from the position that salvation, composed of justification and regeneration, is received freely by faith.

## Presenting the Two Views: Security vs. Insecurity

This article begins by presenting the two major views—eternal security and conditional security—from an objective, scriptural standpoint. Both positions draw support from Scripture, and it would be inaccurate to claim that either has no biblical basis or stands in opposition to Scripture itself. As with many theological tensions, the difference lies not in the presence or absence of scriptural backing, but in how the texts are interpreted. The aim here is to fairly acknowledge that both views are rooted in the biblical text before exploring their underlying assumptions and implications.

### The Case for Eternal Security

1. **Salvation is eternal in nature—not probationary**  
   > “I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.”  
   > — *John 10:28*

   > “For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.”  
   > — *Romans 11:29*

2. **Salvation is God’s work, secured by His power**  
   > “He who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.”  
   > — *Philippians 1:6*

   > “Who are kept by the power of God through faith for salvation…”  
   > — *1 Peter 1:5*

3. **Justification is once-for-all—not reversible**  
   > “Therefore, having been justified by faith…”  
   > — *Romans 5:1*


The basis of this position is that if salvation is truly eternal, and if it is given by grace apart from works, then it cannot be undone by human failure or unbelief, for that would imply that human will or behavior sustains what God alone began. Limited interpretation of the referenced Scripture has been intentionally provided, as this section is simply meant to present the general view of eternal security.


### The Case for Conditional Security

1. **Warnings of falling away or disqualification**

   > “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’… I never knew you; depart from me.”  
   > — *Matthew 7:21–23*

   > “It is impossible… and then have fallen away, to restore them again to repentance.”  
   > — *Hebrews 6:4–6*

   > “I discipline my body… lest… I myself should be disqualified.”  
   > — *1 Corinthians 9:27*

2. **Conditional promises in Revelation**

   > “If you will not wake up, I will come like a thief…”  
   > — *Revelation 3:3*

   > “I will not blot out his name from the book of life…”  
   > — *Revelation 3:5*

3. **Theological concern: God respects human will**  
   A believer can, by this view, choose to walk away and forfeit salvation.

### Prooftext & Natural Appeal
Thus, the doctrine of insecurity is not based on a single prooftext but on a collection of warnings, conditions, and exhortations throughout the New Testament. Its strength is practical and pastoral: believers must continue in faith, lest they fall.

At this point, it’s important to note that there is no Scripture that directly says a believer’s salvation is either eternally secure or conditionally maintained. Face-value arguments are not sufficient grounds for serious theological conclusions. However, to maintain balance, it must be acknowledged that the language of warning and conditionality more naturally appeals to the latter view. But natural appeal is not a sound basis for doctrine.

We must be cautious not to let our expectations or preferences shape our theology. For example, Jehovah’s Witnesses commonly argue that Jesus never explicitly claimed to be God. This is a classic case of natural appeal: the assumption that if Jesus were divine, He would have declared it plainly, according to modern standards of clarity. But in John 8:58, when Jesus says, “Before Abraham was, I am,” His audience immediately grasped the implication and sought to stone Him for blasphemy. His claim was not unclear—it simply wasn’t framed in terms that satisfy modern expectations. This shows how natural appeal can obscure truth by filtering Scripture through our own assumptions rather than letting Scripture interpret itself.

Likewise, doctrines like the Trinity, election, or even the incarnation defy natural categories. They are not always intuitive, and at times they appear paradoxical. Yet they are affirmed not because they are naturally appealing, but because they are scripturally grounded. Therefore, when it comes to eternal security, one must not lean too heavily on what "sounds right" or "feels consistent," but instead wrestle with the fullness of revelation, however uncomfortable or mysterious it may be.

## A Closer Look at Objections to Eternal Security

While the insecurity position appeals to several serious passages of Scripture, it’s worth noting that many of the most forceful objections to eternal security are not exegetical, but moral, ethical, rational, or theological in nature.

These objections often sound less like “the Bible says…” and more like “But that doesn’t seem fair…” or “That would make people careless…”

1. **Motivation Objection**  
   > “If salvation can’t be lost, what’s the motivation to live righteously?”

This view assumes that fear of losing salvation is the primary driver of Christian obedience.

2. **Justice Objection**  
   > “How can God save someone who continues in sin?”

The concern here is that security makes God appear permissive or unjust.

3. **Authenticity Objection**  
   > “Isn’t it just redefining salvation when we say someone who fell away was never saved?”

This objection critiques the idea that a true believer can never fall away by saying it’s a no-lose proposition that lacks meaningful criteria.

4. **Fear of Cheap Grace**  
   > “If salvation is secure, people will live however they want.”

The idea here is that grace must be bounded by threat or consequence to be effective.

These objections are not without emotional and pastoral weight, but they reveal something crucial: that the rejection of eternal security is often driven less by careful exegesis of the text, and more by what is assumed must be true of God, faith, or the believer's moral accountability.

In other words, the debate over security is not just scriptural—it is also moral, theological, and psychological. And that means the question becomes: are ethical instincts being allowed to interpret Scripture, or is Scripture being allowed to reshape those instincts?

This moral weight, however, is not one-sided. In the next section, it becomes clear that insecurity carries its own serious theological and pastoral consequences—ones that are often overlooked but equally destabilizing.

## The Dilemma of Insecurity

The call of the gospel to the unbeliever is salvation. But the call to the believer is not the maintenance of salvation—it is maturity.

Throughout the New Testament, believers are consistently exhorted to grow up into Christ, not to resecure what has already been given. The Christian life is not a cycle of constant re-entry, but a forward path of transformation and growth. The emphasis is not on keeping one’s place in the family of God, but on walking in the fullness of that relationship.

> “Let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity…”  
> — *Hebrews 6:1*

The Christian life is not about maintaining salvation, but maturing in Christ.

> “Him we proclaim… that we may present everyone mature in Christ.”
> — *Colossians 1:28*

> "Until we all attain… to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ."
> — *Ephesians 4:13*

> "I am again in the anguish of childbirth until Christ is formed in you!"
>— *Galatians 4:19*

> “Not that I have already obtained this… but I press on…”
>— *Philippians 3:12–14*

This is the consistent pattern: having been saved, the believer is called not to hover around the entry point of salvation, but to press forward into spiritual adulthood. The goal is not survival, but sanctification—not retaining salvation, but being conformed to Christ.

But herein lies the pastoral dilemma: the doctrine of insecurity, however well-intentioned, introduces a paralyzing fear that becomes the very obstacle to the maturity Scripture commands. The lived experience of believers under this teaching often produces spiritual anxiety rather than spiritual growth.

If a believer is constantly unsure of their standing before God—constantly wondering whether they have lost or might lose salvation—how can they move on to deeper things? Hebrews 6 is not a warning against false assurance, but a rebuke of spiritual immaturity. The writer urges the church to grow up, to leave behind foundational anxieties about repentance and salvation, and to go on to what is complete and lasting. But for the insecure believer, that maturity is elusive—because the foundation itself feels unstable.

Rather than Christ being the anchor of the soul (Hebrews 6:19), the believer becomes the anchor of their own salvation—relying not on the finished work of Christ, but on the fragile continuity of their own faith. In that world, spiritual growth is replaced by spiritual self-surveillance. One cannot build when the ground beneath them always feels like it may collapse.

This was the very kind of despair Martin Luther described with the German word Anfechtungen—a deep, gnawing anxiety about whether one was truly saved. Though Luther battled with the fear of not doing enough works, the insecurity we describe stems from a similar root: a fear that salvation, though once received, is easily lost. And ironically, this fear—designed to prevent false comfort—produces instead a faith that never finds rest, and therefore never grows.

The believer cannot mature if he is always questioning whether he belongs. The fear of losing salvation becomes the very thing that prevents the Christian from going on to maturity—and that is precisely what Hebrews 6 warns against.


## The Kingdom Reward Doctrine: A Forgotten Third Way

If salvation is eternally secure, what becomes of motivation? If a believer cannot lose their salvation, what incentive remains to live righteously, to endure suffering, or to pursue holiness?

These are fair and weighty pastoral questions that arise from genuine concern for Christian living. But they assume a binary that Scripture does not: that the only consequence for sin or negligence must be the loss of salvation. Scripture presents a better, fuller vision—a theology of reward and loss within the Kingdom of God that addresses these pastoral concerns while preserving the security of salvation.

This perspective, often articulated among Brethren teachers and faithful expositors, distinguishes between eternal salvation and eternal reward. Or as this framework expresses it:

> **“Once saved, always saved—but not once forgiven, always forgiven.”**

### A. Salvation Is Secure, But Reward Is Conditional

Eternal life is the gift of God, secured by Christ’s finished work and received through faith (Rom. 6:23; John 5:24). But reward—what we inherit, how we reign, the commendation we receive—is tied to faithfulness, maturity, and obedience.

> The believer’s work will be tested by fire. “If anyone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.”
> — *1 Corinthians 3:13–15*


> “We will all stand before the judgment seat of God.”
> — *Romans 14:10*

> "We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due… whether good or evil."
> — *2 Corinthians 5:10*

> “Behold, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense with me, to repay each one for what he has done.”
> — *Revelation 22:12*

These are not warnings of damnation—but of loss for the believer who fails to grow, endure, or steward what has been entrusted.

At this point, it's important to recall the common ground. Salvation is received freely by faith through the grace of God. However, reward is earned by works through the maturity of the believer.

### B. Motivation Reframed: Desire for Reward

The most common objection to eternal security is this: If salvation cannot be lost, why obey? If salvation is eternally secure, then does sin matter?

But this objection presumes that fear is the only effective motivator. Scripture offers something far better: the joy of pleasing Christ, the hope of reigning with Him, and the weight of eternal reward. Jesus doesn’t threaten His servants with hell to motivate them—He offers the joy of hearing:

> “Well done, good and faithful servant…”  
> — *Matthew 25:21*

Likewise, Paul writes not from fear of being cut off, but from longing for reward:

> “There is laid up for me the crown of righteousness…”  
> — *2 Timothy 4:7–8*

In this light, maturity becomes central. The goal is not maintenance of salvation, but growth into fullness—so that believers may receive a full reward (2 John 1:8) and not be ashamed at His coming (1 John 2:28).

> “So that we may receive a full reward.”  
> — *2 John 1:8*

### C. Discipline and Forgiveness Still Matter

Some will say: If I'm once saved, why does ongoing confession or repentance matter?

Here the second half of the key phrase emerges: "but not once forgiven, always forgiven." While salvation is a once-for-all judicial declaration, forgiveness operates on a relational, ongoing basis. The believer's legal standing before God is settled permanently, but their experiential fellowship with the Father requires continual maintenance.

This distinction between **union** and **communion** is crucial:

- **Union with God** is permanent—established at salvation and secured by Christ's work
- **Communion with God** is experiential—maintained through confession and obedience

Sin breaks communion, not union. Just as a child remains a child even when fellowship with their parent is strained by disobedience, so the believer remains God's child even when sin disrupts the sweetness of that relationship.

> "If we confess our sins, He is faithful… to forgive us."
> — *1 John 1:9*

Note that John writes to believers ("if *we* confess") and assumes ongoing sin that requires ongoing confession. This is not about regaining salvation, but about maintaining fellowship.

> "The Lord disciplines the one He loves."
> — *Hebrews 12:6*

> "Confess your sins to one another… that you may be healed."
> — *James 5:16*

David understood this distinction perfectly. In Psalm 51, during his prayer of repentance after his sin with Bathsheba, he asked not for salvation to be restored to him, but for the joy of salvation to be restored:

> "Restore to me the gladness of Your salvation..."
> — *Psalm 51:12*

David knew his relationship with God was intact, but his fellowship had been broken. He needed restoration of joy, not restoration of salvation.

This is why the phrase "but not once forgiven, always forgiven" is so important. It acknowledges that believers require ongoing cleansing for ongoing sin. Salvation cannot be lost, but forgiveness is ongoing, and discipline is real. The believer who walks in sin will experience loss of reward, diminished joy, and in some cases, even temporal judgment (1 Cor. 11:30).

Therefore, confession and repentance remain vital—not to maintain salvation, but to maintain fellowship, joy, and fruitfulness in the Christian life.

### D. Grace and Gravity

The doctrine of Kingdom reward threads the needle: it preserves the grace of eternal security while maintaining the gravity of Christian responsibility.

- It refutes lawlessness: by showing that works still matter—not for salvation, but for reward.

-  It removes fear: by grounding the believer’s identity in Christ, not in personal consistency.

-  It honors maturity: making the goal of the Christian life not just endurance, but growth into fullness—a life that will be tested, evaluated, and rewarded.

In short, the believer who trusts in eternal security is not released from responsibility. Rather, he is freed from fear so that he can pursue Christ with greater purpose.

> "Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering… and let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works."  
> — *Hebrews 10:23–24*

### E. Summary

In summary, the doctrine presented here is more accurately described as dispensational reward and discipline. The purpose of this article is not to present a comprehensive biblical defense of the view—that work appears in the appendix below—but rather to offer a pastoral framework that moves beyond the conventional security/insecurity dichotomy. This perspective aims to address the lived experience of believers while maintaining both theological integrity and the gravity of scriptural warnings.

The doctrine stands on the following affirmations:

1. The believer's salvation is eternally secure, forming both the initiation and unshakable foundation of Christian life.
2. The believer's conduct still matters, as they remain subject to God's discipline in this age (cf. Heb. 12:6–11) and judgment in the next (cf. Rom. 14:10–12).
3. The believer's works will be evaluated at the judgment seat of Christ (cf. 2 Cor. 5:10; Rom. 14:10), which will determine their reward and role in the age to come.
4. This coming age is the millennial kingdom, Christ's 1000-year reign (cf. Rev. 20:4–6), often associated with the term "kingdom of the heavens" as it pertains to reward and participation.
5. Believers who mature—as evidenced by faithful living and fruitful works—will reign with Christ during this kingdom (cf. 2 Tim. 2:12; Rev. 3:21).
6. Believers who fail to mature will suffer loss (cf. 1 Cor. 3:15), which Scripture characterizes in metaphorical terms such as fire (1 Cor. 3:13–15), outer darkness (Matt. 25:30), and missing the wedding feast (Matt. 22:11–14)—not as a loss of eternal life, but of reward.
7. All believers will enter into eternity after the kingdom age ends. The loss spoken of is age-specific, not eternal. Eternal life is the guaranteed inheritance of every believer, not subject to works or maturity.
8. Scriptures that appear to teach salvation by works or the loss of salvation are, in this framework, more accurately interpreted as referring to the believer's reward or discipline, either in this age or the one to come. (See the appendix for detailed exegetical analysis of these passages.)

While this doctrine does not directly answer the question of what some refer to as “future salvation,” it does suggest that salvation is organic—that is, a living process that unfolds over time. In this view, believers are not merely saved from judgment, but are being saved into the fullness of Christ, with maturity as a key marker of progress. This process is especially relevant to kingdom-related themes in the New Testament, where reward, inheritance, and participation in the age to come are connected to spiritual growth and faithful obedience. Thus, “salvation” is not a one-dimensional term, but a multifaceted reality encompassing past deliverance, present transformation, and future fulfillment. This organic and kingdom-oriented understanding of salvation deserves its own careful exploration.

Some approach this question from the standpoint of assurance—asking, "How can a believer know they are saved?" But assurance is a separate issue. It speaks to the believer’s confidence in God’s faithfulness, not necessarily the timing or outcome of every stage of salvation. Assurance is available in abundance, but it comes through spiritual growth, obedience, and intimacy with Christ—not by flattening all biblical warnings into theoretical impossibilities. That too deserves careful attention in its own right.


## Conclusion: Security with Sobriety

### A. Objection: Isn’t this still fear-based?

Some who affirm eternal security will ask: “If you’re still warning believers of consequences—of loss, of rebuke, of discipline—aren’t you just replacing one fear with another?”

In part, the answer is yes. But not all fear is destructive. The problem isn’t fear—it’s what kind of fear and what consequence it’s tied to.

Scripture clearly teaches a reverent fear of the Lord, even for those eternally secure:

> “Since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire.”
> — *Hebrews 12:28–29*

The issue, then, is not the presence of fear, but the nature of the consequence. The Kingdom doctrine does not threaten believers with damnation, but with loss—loss of reward, joy, honor, and commendation. This is a sober reality. There is no way around God’s righteousness. Not all believers will hear “Well done.” And that ought to move us—not toward terror, but toward seriousness.

So yes, there is a fear—but it is the fear of accountability, not the fear of abandonment.

### B. Objection: Isn’t this just purgatory?

Purgatory is a Catholic doctrine. The Catholic catechism is actually quite vague on the subject, perhaps intentionally so. The most generous reading is that purgatory is some kind of temporal refinement before the final judgment. But exactly when, how long, or in what form? The catechism leaves these questions open.

That vague timing is about the only surface similarity with dispensational reward and discipline, both being temporary and before eternity. Though, technically, dispensational reward and discipline follows the judgment seat of Christ and is distinct from the great white throne judgment for unbelievers. The likeness is really incidental and mostly due to the catechism’s lack of clarity.

The real difference, and the main point of contention, is this: Catholic doctrine attaches purgatory to the practice of praying for the dead or contributing to the dead’s purification. As the catechism itself states:

> “This teaching is also based on the practice of prayer for the dead…”

That’s something dispensational reward and discipline explicitly denies. Every believer’s reward or loss is based on their own life and living before God, nothing added by others after death.

At best, the only definitional overlap is that something happens after death and before eternity. But that's far too thin to call them anything alike.

### C. Closing Word

This article has focused primarily on the pastoral implications rather than comprehensive exegetical defense. The doctrine of salvation—its nature, assurance, fruit, and reward—has been the subject of centuries of careful study, debate, and prayer. This article does not presume to close that conversation.

What has been offered here is another way to hold the tension:

- A way to uphold the security of salvation without falling into moral laxity.
- A way to uphold moral seriousness without compromising the free grace of the gospel.
- A way to see maturity as not just an ideal, but as the very path to Kingdom inheritance.

This is offered not as a final word, but as a contribution—a perspective that may help the believer walk in assurance, grow toward maturity, and live with the joyful sobriety of one who will give an account, not to remain saved, but to receive what is promised.

> "Look to yourselves, that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may win a full reward."  — *2 John 1:8*

## Appendix: Exegetical Analysis of Key Passages

The following appendix provides detailed exegetical analysis of passages commonly cited in discussions of eternal security. While the main body of this article focused on pastoral implications, this section addresses the interpretive challenges and offers support for the dispensational reward and discipline framework.

### A. Passages Often Cited Against Eternal Security

#### 1. Matthew 7:21–23 — "I Never Knew You"

> "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'"

**Common Interpretation:** These are believers who lose their salvation due to lawlessness.

**Dispensational Interpretation:** Several factors point to kingdom exclusion rather than eternal condemnation:

1. **Kingdom Language:** The text specifically mentions "entering the kingdom of heaven," not eternal salvation or hell. This aligns with millennial kingdom participation rather than eternal destiny.

2. **Recognition of Lordship:** These individuals clearly acknowledge Jesus as Lord and have ministered in His name with apparent supernatural results. This suggests some level of genuine relationship.

3. **"I Never Knew You":** The Greek *oudepote* (never) is puzzling if these were once-saved individuals. However, the word "knew" (*ginōskō*) doesn't necessarily mean "saved" but often refers to intimate, personal knowledge or approval. This must be reconciled with Romans 10:13: "whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved." These individuals clearly called Jesus "Lord" (twice for emphasis), yet Jesus says He "never knew" them.

   The resolution lies in understanding that "knew" refers to intimate fellowship or approval, not salvation itself. Jesus may never have had intimate knowledge of their hearts or approved of their methodology, even while they genuinely called upon Him for salvation. They were saved by calling on His name (Rom. 10:13), but their lawless approach to ministry meant He never "knew" them in the sense of approving their works or having intimate fellowship with them. This fits perfectly with the judgment seat evaluation where works are tested and found wanting (1 Cor. 3:13-15), resulting in loss of reward but not loss of salvation.

4. **Works-Focused Plea:** Their defense is entirely based on their works, not their faith or relationship. This fits the pattern of believers who will suffer loss at the judgment seat due to flawed motivation or methodology.

#### 2. Hebrews 6:4–6 — Impossible to Restore

> "For it is impossible, in the case of those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have shared in the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come, and then have fallen away, to restore them again to repentance, since they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt."

**Common Interpretation:** Believers can fall away and lose salvation permanently.

**Dispensational Interpretation:**

1. **Context of Maturity:** The broader context (Hebrews 5:11–6:12) focuses on spiritual maturity, not salvation maintenance. The writer rebukes readers for remaining "infants" and urges them to "go on to maturity."

2. **Hypothetical Language:** Many commentators note the conditional structure may be hypothetical—"if they fall away"—setting up an argument rather than describing an actual occurrence.

3. **Restoration to Repentance:** The text speaks of being impossible to restore "to repentance," not to salvation. This could refer to the specific kind of foundational repentance mentioned in 6:1, suggesting these believers have moved beyond basic doctrines and should not regress.

4. **Kingdom Privileges:** The language of "tasting heavenly gifts" and "powers of the age to come" points to kingdom-related experiences. The loss may be of these privileges rather than eternal life.

#### 3. Hebrews 10:26–31 — Willful Sin After Knowledge

> "For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries."

**Common Interpretation:** Believers who continue in willful sin face eternal damnation.

**Dispensational Interpretation:**

1. **Audience:** The letter addresses "holy brothers who share in a heavenly calling" (3:1). The "we" language includes the author among those potentially facing this judgment.

2. **Nature of Judgment:** The text speaks of "judgment" and "fury of fire" but doesn't specify eternal hell. The language could refer to severe temporal discipline or exclusion from kingdom privileges.

3. **No Sacrifice Remains:** This doesn't necessarily mean no forgiveness is available, but that the sacrifice of Christ cannot be repeated. It may warn against treating His sacrifice lightly, with consequences affecting reward rather than salvation.

4. **Parallel to Mosaic Law:** The comparison to those who rejected Moses' law (v. 28) suggests covenant discipline rather than eternal judgment, as many who violated the law were disciplined but remained within Israel.

#### 4. 2 Peter 2:20–22 — Entangled Again

> "For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first."

**Common Interpretation:** Believers can return to sin and lose salvation.

**Dispensational Interpretation:**

1. **Knowledge vs. Faith:** The text speaks of "knowledge" (epignosis) of Christ but not necessarily saving faith. Knowledge can be intellectual without being regenerative.

2. **Escape from Defilement:** This could describe moral reformation through Christian influence without genuine conversion—a common occurrence in Christian environments.

3. **The Dog and Sow:** Peter's illustration (v. 22) uses animals returning to their nature, suggesting these individuals never experienced a change of nature through regeneration.

4. **Worse State:** The "worse state" may refer to greater judgment due to having known better, consistent with varying degrees of punishment based on knowledge (Luke 12:47–48).

#### 5. Revelation 2:11 — Hurt by the Second Death

> "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who overcomes will not be hurt by the second death."

**Common Interpretation:** This suggests that believers who don't overcome can be hurt by the second death, implying loss of salvation.

**Dispensational Interpretation:**

1. **Specific Overcomers:** The "overcomers" here are those believers who successfully overcame their particular situation in Smyrna—facing persecution, poverty, and slander from false Jews (Rev. 2:8-10). These are believers who are dispensationally rewarded for their faithfulness under trial, and therefore are also subject to dispensational discipline if unfaithful.

2. **Second Death Limited to Unrighteous:** Revelation 20:11-15 clearly establishes that only the unrighteous face the second death—those whose names are not found in the book of life are "thrown into the lake of fire." Romans 2:8 speaks of "wrath and fury" for "those who... do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness." Since believers are declared righteous (Rom. 5:1), they cannot be cast into the second death.

3. **"Hurt" vs. "Cast Into":** The text says overcomers will not be "hurt" (*adikeō*) by the second death, not that they won't be "cast into" it. This distinction is crucial. While believers cannot be cast into the lake of fire (the ultimate second death), they may experience "hurt" or harm from the consequences of unfaithfulness—shame, loss of reward, or exclusion from kingdom privileges.

4. **Dispensational Consequences:** This aligns with the broader dispensational framework where faithful believers receive kingdom rewards while unfaithful believers suffer loss (1 Cor. 3:15). The "hurt" may refer to the painful experience of shame and loss at the judgment seat of Christ for those who were not faithful in their testing.

#### 6. Revelation 3:5 — Blotted from the Book of Life

> "The one who overcomes will be clothed thus in white garments, and I will never blot his name out of the book of life. I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels."

**Common Interpretation:** This implies that names can be blotted out, threatening the eternal security of believers.

**Dispensational Interpretation:**

1. **Multi-Age Book of Life:** The book of life represents the totality of God's blessings across all ages—present benefits, millennial kingdom participation, and eternal rewards. It is not limited to salvation alone but encompasses the full scope of divine blessing throughout time.

2. **Age-Specific Blotting:** A believer may be written in the book today (salvation secured), potentially blotted out in the next age (excluded from millennial kingdom privileges due to unfaithfulness), yet restored for eternity. This allows for dispensational consequences without threatening eternal security.

3. **Repentance and Restoration Logic:** If one accepts that names can be blotted out (as the text implies), then logically, restoration through repentance must also be possible. The very concept of blotting presupposes the possibility of being written back in, maintaining hope for the unfaithful believer.

4. **Promise to Faithful Overcomers:** The promise to overcomers in Sardis—those who did not "defile their garments" (Rev. 3:4)—is that they will never experience such blotting. Their faithfulness ensures continuous blessing across all ages, from present salvation through millennial kingdom participation to eternal reward.

5. **Dispensational Consistency:** This interpretation maintains both the security of salvation (eternal life cannot be lost) and the reality of kingdom consequences (privileges can be forfeited but restored). It provides hope for restoration while maintaining the seriousness of present faithfulness.



### B. Passages Supporting Eternal Security

#### 1. John 10:27–30 — Never Perish

> "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand."

**Analysis:**
- The promise is absolute: "they will never perish" (ou mē apolōntai eis ton aiōna)
- Double security: both the Son's hand and the Father's hand
- The life given is eternal in nature, not probationary
- "No one" includes the believer themselves—if they could remove themselves, Jesus' promise would be incomplete

#### 2. Romans 8:38–39 — Nothing Can Separate

> "For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord."

**Analysis:**
- Paul's confidence is complete: "I am sure" (pepeismai)
- The list is comprehensive: "anything else in all creation"
- If believers could lose salvation through sin or unbelief, this promise would be false
- The love of God in Christ Jesus includes justification and eternal life

#### 3. Ephesians 1:13–14 — Sealed for Redemption

> "In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory."

**Analysis:**
- The sealing occurs at the moment of belief, not after probation
- The Spirit serves as guarantee (arrabōn)—a commercial term for a down payment that guarantees full payment
- The sealing is "until" (eis) the day of redemption, indicating its permanence
- God's glory is at stake in completing what He began

#### 4. 1 Peter 1:3–5 — Kept by God's Power

> "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, who by God's power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time."

**Analysis:**
- Birth metaphor: just as physical birth cannot be undone, spiritual birth is permanent
- The inheritance is "kept in heaven"—beyond human ability to lose
- Believers are "guarded" (phroureō) by God's power, not their own
- The faith "through" which they are guarded is itself enabled by God's power

### C. Passages on Loss of Fellowship in This Age

While salvation remains secure, Scripture clearly teaches that believers can experience real loss in this present age through disrupted fellowship with God. These passages demonstrate the "not once forgiven, always forgiven" principle—showing that ongoing sin affects communion with God even while union remains intact.

#### 1. Ephesians 4:30 — Grieving the Holy Spirit

> "And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption."

**Analysis:**
- The Spirit seals believers "for the day of redemption"—indicating permanent security
- Yet believers can "grieve" the Spirit through sin, disrupting fellowship
- The context (v. 25-32) lists specific sins that grieve the Spirit: lying, anger, stealing, corrupt speech, bitterness
- This establishes that while the Spirit remains (security), His joy and blessing can be hindered (fellowship)

#### 2. 1 Thessalonians 5:19 — Quenching the Spirit

> "Do not quench the Spirit."

**Analysis:**
- The Spirit's fire can be "quenched" by believers' choices and attitudes
- Context suggests this relates to despising prophecy and resisting spiritual gifts
- The Spirit doesn't leave the believer, but His work can be suppressed
- This demonstrates loss of spiritual vitality and power without loss of salvation

#### 3. Psalm 51:11-12 — Loss of God's Presence and Joy

> "Do not cast me away from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit."

**Analysis:**
- David distinguishes between being "cast away" (which he fears) and losing "joy" (which he experienced)
- He asks for the Spirit not to be taken (Old Testament context), but knows the joy is already gone
- He seeks restoration of joy, not restoration of salvation
- This illustrates the difference between positional security and experiential fellowship

#### 4. 1 Corinthians 11:30-32 — Temporal Discipline and Death

> "That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged. But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world."

**Analysis:**
- Believers face real consequences for sin: weakness, illness, even death
- This discipline is distinct from condemnation—it's corrective, not punitive
- The purpose is to prevent condemnation "along with the world"
- Demonstrates that temporal loss serves to preserve eternal security

#### 5. Hebrews 12:5-11 — Divine Discipline

> "My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved by him. For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives... For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it."

**Analysis:**
- Discipline is proof of sonship, not threat to it
- The pain is real and present—"painful rather than pleasant"
- The goal is "peaceful fruit of righteousness"—restoration, not condemnation
- Shows God's commitment to both relationship (love) and holiness (discipline)

#### 6. 1 John 1:9 — Ongoing Need for Confession

> "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."

**Analysis:**
- Written to believers ("we"), assuming ongoing sin and need for confession
- "If we confess" implies fellowship can be broken and restored
- The forgiveness here is relational, not judicial—maintaining fellowship with the Father
- "Cleanse us" points to experiential purification, not positional justification

#### 7. James 4:8 — Drawing Near to God

> "Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded."

**Analysis:**
- Written to believers who have become "double-minded"
- God's nearness is experiential and conditional on the believer's approach
- The call to "cleanse" and "purify" assumes contamination has occurred
- Shows that intimacy with God requires ongoing attention to holiness

### D. Synthesis: The Present Reality of Loss

These passages establish that believers face genuine loss in this present age:

1. **Loss of the Spirit's Joy**: Through grieving and quenching His work
2. **Loss of God's Felt Presence**: Through unconfessed sin and compromise
3. **Loss of Spiritual Vitality**: Through neglecting fellowship and holiness
4. **Loss of Physical Well-being**: Through divine discipline for persistent sin
5. **Loss of Peace and Confidence**: Through broken fellowship with the Father

This present-age loss serves several purposes:
- **Corrective**: Bringing believers back to fellowship
- **Protective**: Preventing worse consequences
- **Educational**: Teaching the seriousness of holiness
- **Motivational**: Encouraging ongoing confession and obedience

Importantly, none of these losses threaten eternal security. Instead, they demonstrate God's commitment to both relationship and righteousness—preserving salvation while pursuing sanctification.

### E. Passages on Judgment and Reward

#### 1. 1 Corinthians 3:11–15 — Tested by Fire

> "For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw—each one's work will become manifest, for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done. If the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward. If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire."

**Analysis:**
- Clear distinction between the person (saved) and the work (tested)
- The foundation (Christ) cannot be changed—it determines salvation
- The building materials determine reward—the quality of Christian living
- "Saved, but only as through fire" indicates salvation without reward
- This passage directly supports the security/reward distinction

#### 2. 2 Corinthians 5:10 — Judgment Seat of Christ

> "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil."

**Analysis:**
- Bēma (judgment seat) was used for athletic competitions and civil courts, not criminal trials
- The focus is on receiving "what is due"—reward or loss based on works
- "We must all" includes Paul and all believers
- The evaluation is of things done "in the body"—the Christian life, not pre-conversion sin

#### 3. Revelation 3:11 — Hold Fast Your Crown

> "I am coming soon. Hold fast what you have, so that no one may take your crown."

**Analysis:**
- The warning is to believers in the church at Philadelphia
- "Crown" (stephanos) refers to a victor's wreath, symbolizing reward
- The possibility of loss is real but refers to reward, not salvation
- The exhortation is to "hold fast"—implying ongoing responsibility for reward

### F. Synthesis: The Two-Track System

The scriptural evidence suggests a two-track system:

1. **Salvation Track:** Received by faith alone, eternally secure, based on Christ's finished work
2. **Reward Track:** Earned through faithful living, subject to loss, based on the believer's works

This framework allows both sets of passages to be taken seriously without compromising either divine sovereignty in salvation or human responsibility in discipleship. Warnings of "loss" become meaningful without threatening eternal security, and promises of security stand firm without undermining moral urgency.

The pastoral implications are profound: believers can rest securely in their salvation while taking seriously their calling to maturity and fruitfulness. Fear is replaced with motivation, anxiety with assurance, and spiritual self-surveillance with confident growth toward Christ-likeness.
