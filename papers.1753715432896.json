Unlike other theological debates that allow for degrees of nuance or synthesis, the question of salvation’s permanence presents a binary dilemma: either salvation, once granted, is secure—or it can be lost.\n\nConsider debates such as predestination versus free will. While contentious, this discussion allows room for various nuanced positions—like compatibilism or limited libertarianism. Likewise, the debate over imputed versus infused righteousness features hybrid views that attempt to bridge elements of both. These are not strictly either/or. But contrast that with the question of Christ’s deity: Is Jesus God? That is binary. Either He is the eternal, omnipotent God, or He is not. And though heresies exist, the orthodox Christian faith holds firmly to the former.\n\nThe same binary structure applies to the question at hand: Can someone lose their salvation? The answer must be yes or no. There is no middle ground. And that’s what makes this doctrine particularly polarizing. While it may not rise to the level of an essential like the deity of Christ, it is nonetheless a critical question—one that shapes assurance, discipleship, and how we understand the nature of grace itself. This article approaches the doctrine with that attitude in mind: it is not essential for salvation, but it is essential for clarity.\n\n## Salvation by Faith, Not by Works\n\nBefore I explore the question of whether salvation can be lost, I must first begin with common ground: that salvation is by faith, and by faith alone. This section is intended to affirm that foundation—that salvation is a free gift received through faith, not a reward earned by works.\n\nWhile some theological systems assert that salvation is earned or kept through works, this article does not engage with those directly. That is a separate matter. Instead, this article assumes agreement with the historic Protestant conviction that salvation is received by grace through faith. This may also resonate with readers who affirm that salvation is initially received by faith but believe it must be maintained by works. For this section, however, I am focusing specifically on the receiving act—not the question of continuation.\n\nScripture teaches clearly that salvation comes by faith:\n\n> “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.”  \n> — *Ephesians 2:8–9*\n\nTo be saved, one must believe:\n\n> “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved.”  \n> — *Acts 16:31*\n\nAnd what is received through that belief is not a wage or a reward, but a gift:\n\n> “Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due. But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.”  \n> — *Romans 4:4–5*\n\nSalvation is nothing less than eternal life—the very Zoe life of God:\n> \"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.\"\n> — *John 3:16*\n\n> “God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life…”  \n> — *1 John 5:11–12*\n\n> “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life.”  \n> — *John 6:47*\n\n### Justification and Regeneration\n\nWhen a person believes in Christ as Savior, that faith apprehends Him, and the result is twofold:\n\n- **Justification**: being declared righteous before God  \n  > “Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.”  \n  > — *Romans 5:1*\n\n- **Regeneration**: being born again by the life of God  \n  > “Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God.”  \n  > — *1 John 5:1*\n\n  > “He saved us… by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit.”  \n  > — *Titus 3:5*\n\n  > “Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes Him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment but has passed from death to life.”  \n  > — *John 5:24*\n\nTherefore as I investigate the security or insecurity of salvation I come from the position that salvation, composed of justification and regeneration, is received freely by faith.\n\n## Presenting the Two Views: Security vs. Insecurity\n\nThis article begins by presenting the two major views—eternal security and conditional security—from an objective, scriptural standpoint. Both positions draw support from Scripture, and it would be inaccurate to claim that either has no biblical basis or stands in opposition to Scripture itself. As with many theological tensions, the difference lies not in the presence or absence of scriptural backing, but in how the texts are interpreted. My aim is to fairly acknowledge that both views are rooted in the biblical text before exploring their underlying assumptions and implications.\n\n### The Case for Eternal Security\n\n1. **Salvation is eternal in nature—not probationary**  \n   > “I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.”  \n   > — *John 10:28*\n\n   > “For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.”  \n   > — *Romans 11:29*\n\n2. **Salvation is God’s work, secured by His power**  \n   > “He who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.”  \n   > — *Philippians 1:6*\n\n   > “Who are kept by the power of God through faith for salvation…”  \n   > — *1 Peter 1:5*\n\n3. **Justification is once-for-all—not reversible**  \n   > “Therefore, having been justified by faith…”  \n   > — *Romans 5:1*\n\n\nThe basic of this position is that if salvation is truly eternal, and if it is given by grace apart from works, then it cannot be undone by human failure or unbelief, for that would imply that human will or behavior sustains what God alone began. I have intentionally presented limited interpretation of referenced Scripture as this section is simply meant to present a general view of eternal security.\n\n\n### The Case for Conditional Security\n\n1. **Warnings of falling away or disqualification**\n\n   > “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’… I never knew you; depart from me.”  \n   > — *Matthew 7:21–23*\n\n   > “It is impossible… and then have fallen away, to restore them again to repentance.”  \n   > — *Hebrews 6:4–6*\n\n   > “I discipline my body… lest… I myself should be disqualified.”  \n   > — *1 Corinthians 9:27*\n\n2. **Conditional promises in Revelation**\n\n   > “If you will not wake up, I will come like a thief…”  \n   > — *Revelation 3:3*\n\n   > “I will not blot out his name from the book of life…”  \n   > — *Revelation 3:5*\n\n3. **Theological concern: God respects human will**  \n   A believer can, by this view, choose to walk away and forfeit salvation.\n\n### Prooftext & Natural Appeal\nThus, the doctrine of insecurity is not based on a single prooftext but on a collection of warnings, conditions, and exhortations throughout the New Testament. Its strength is practical and pastoral: believers must continue in faith, lest they fall.\n\nAt this point, it’s important to note that there is no Scripture that directly says a believer’s salvation is either eternally secure or conditionally maintained. Face-value arguments are not sufficient grounds for serious theological conclusions. However, to balance my perspective, I am willing to acknowledge that the language of warning and conditionality more naturally appeals to the latter view. But natural appeal is not a sound basis for doctrine.\n\nWe must be cautious not to let our expectations or preferences shape our theology. For example, Jehovah’s Witnesses commonly argue that Jesus never explicitly claimed to be God. This is a classic case of natural appeal: the assumption that if Jesus were divine, He would have declared it plainly, according to modern standards of clarity. But in John 8:58, when Jesus says, “Before Abraham was, I am,” His audience immediately grasped the implication and sought to stone Him for blasphemy. His claim was not unclear—it simply wasn’t framed in terms that satisfy modern expectations. This shows how natural appeal can obscure truth by filtering Scripture through our own assumptions rather than letting Scripture interpret itself.\n\nLikewise, doctrines like the Trinity, election, or even the incarnation defy natural categories. They are not always intuitive, and at times they appear paradoxical. Yet they are affirmed not because they are naturally appealing, but because they are scripturally grounded. Therefore, when it comes to eternal security, we must not lean too heavily on what “sounds right” or “feels consistent,” but instead wrestle with the fullness of revelation, however uncomfortable or mysterious it may be.\n\n## A Closer Look at Objections to Eternal Security\n\nWhile the insecurity position appeals to several serious passages of Scripture, it’s worth noting that many of the most forceful objections to eternal security are not exegetical, but moral, ethical, rational, or theological in nature.\n\nThese objections often sound less like “the Bible says…” and more like “But that doesn’t seem fair…” or “That would make people careless…”\n\n1. **Motivation Objection**  \n   > “If salvation can’t be lost, what’s the motivation to live righteously?”\n\nThis view assumes that fear of losing salvation is the primary driver of Christian obedience.\n\n2. **Justice Objection**  \n   > “How can God save someone who continues in sin?”\n\nThe concern here is that security makes God appear permissive or unjust.\n\n3. **Authenticity Objection**  \n   > “Isn’t it just redefining salvation when we say someone who fell away was never saved?”\n\nThis objection critiques the idea that a true believer can never fall away by saying it’s a no-lose proposition that lacks meaningful criteria.\n\n4. **Fear of Cheap Grace**  \n   > “If salvation is secure, people will live however they want.”\n\nThe idea here is that grace must be bounded by threat or consequence to be effective.\n\nThese objections are not without emotional and pastoral weight, but they reveal something crucial: that the rejection of eternal security is often driven less by careful exegesis of the text, and more by what we assume must be true of God, faith, or the believer’s moral accountability.\n\nIn other words, the debate over security is not just scriptural—it is also moral, theological, and psychological. And that means we must ask: are we letting our ethical instincts interpret Scripture, or are we letting Scripture reshape our instincts?\n\nThis moral weight, however, is not one-sided. In the next section, we will consider that insecurity carries its own serious theological and pastoral consequences—ones that are often overlooked but equally destabilizing.\n\n## The Dilemma of Insecurity\n\nThe call of the gospel to the unbeliever is salvation. But the call to the believer is not the maintenance of salvation—it is maturity.\n\nThroughout the New Testament, believers are consistently exhorted to grow up into Christ, not to resecure what has already been given. The Christian life is not a cycle of constant re-entry, but a forward path of transformation and growth. The emphasis is not on keeping one’s place in the family of God, but on walking in the fullness of that relationship.\n\n> “Let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity…”  \n> — *Hebrews 6:1*\n\nThe Christian life is not about maintaining salvation, but maturing in Christ.\n\n> Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity…”\n> — *Hebrews 6:1*\n\n> “Him we proclaim… that we may present everyone mature in Christ.”\n> — *Colossians 1:28*\n\n> \"Until we all attain… to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.\"\n> — *Ephesians 4:13*\n\n> \"I am again in the anguish of childbirth until Christ is formed in you!\"\n>— *Galatians 4:19*\n\n> “Not that I have already obtained this… but I press on…”\n>— *Philippians 3:12–14*\n\nThis is the consistent pattern: having been saved, the believer is called not to hover around the entry point of salvation, but to press forward into spiritual adulthood. The goal is not survival, but sanctification—not retaining salvation, but being conformed to Christ.\n\nBut herein lies the dilemma: the doctrine of insecurity, however well-intentioned, introduces a paralyzing fear that becomes the very obstacle to the maturity Scripture commands.\n\nIf a believer is constantly unsure of their standing before God—constantly wondering whether they have lost or might lose salvation—how can they move on to deeper things? Hebrews 6 is not a warning against false assurance, but a rebuke of spiritual immaturity. The writer urges the church to grow up, to leave behind foundational anxieties about repentance and salvation, and to go on to what is complete and lasting. But for the insecure believer, that maturity is elusive—because the foundation itself feels unstable.\n\nRather than Christ being the anchor of the soul (Hebrews 6:19), the believer becomes the anchor of their own salvation—relying not on the finished work of Christ, but on the fragile continuity of their own faith. In that world, spiritual growth is replaced by spiritual self-surveillance. One cannot build when the ground beneath them always feels like it may collapse.\n\nThis was the very kind of despair Martin Luther described with the German word Anfechtungen—a deep, gnawing anxiety about whether one was truly saved. Though Luther battled with the fear of not doing enough works, the insecurity we describe stems from a similar root: a fear that salvation, though once received, is easily lost. And ironically, this fear—designed to prevent false comfort—produces instead a faith that never finds rest, and therefore never grows.\n\nThe believer cannot mature if he is always questioning whether he belongs. The fear of losing salvation becomes the very thing that prevents the Christian from going on to maturity—and that is precisely what Hebrews 6 warns against.\n\n\n## The Kingdom Reward Doctrine: A Forgotten Third Way\n\nIf salvation is eternally secure, what becomes of motivation? If a believer cannot lose their salvation, what incentive remains to live righteously, to endure suffering, or to pursue holiness?\n\nThese are fair and weighty questions. But they assume a binary that Scripture does not: that the only consequence for sin or negligence must be the loss of salvation. Scripture presents a better, fuller vision—a theology of reward and loss within the Kingdom of God.\n\nThis perspective, often articulated among Brethren teachers and faithful expositors, distinguishes between eternal salvation and eternal reward. Or as I put it:\n\n> **“Once saved, always saved—but not once forgiven, always forgiven.”**\n\n### A. Salvation Is Secure, But Reward Is Conditional\n\nEternal life is the gift of God, secured by Christ’s finished work and received through faith (Rom. 6:23; John 5:24). But reward—what we inherit, how we reign, the commendation we receive—is tied to faithfulness, maturity, and obedience.\n\n> The believer’s work will be tested by fire. “If anyone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.”\n> — *1 Corinthians 3:13–15*\n\n\n> “We will all stand before the judgment seat of God.”\n> — *Romans 14:10*\n\n> \"We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due… whether good or evil.\"\n> — *2 Corinthians 5:10*\n\n> “Behold, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense with me, to repay each one for what he has done.”\n> — *Revelation 22:12*\n\nThese are not warnings of damnation—but of loss for the believer who fails to grow, endure, or steward what has been entrusted.\n\nAt this point, it's important to remind ourselves of our common ground. Salvation is received freely by faith through the grace of God. However, reward is earned by works through the maturity of the believer.\n\n### B. Motivation Reframed: Desire for Reward\n\nThe most common objection to eternal security is this: If salvation cannot be lost, why obey? If salvation is eternally secure, then does sin matter?\n\nBut this objection presumes that fear is the only effective motivator. Scripture offers something far better: the joy of pleasing Christ, the hope of reigning with Him, and the weight of eternal reward. Jesus doesn’t threaten His servants with hell to motivate them—He offers the joy of hearing:\n\n> “Well done, good and faithful servant…”  \n> — *Matthew 25:21*\n\nLikewise, Paul writes not from fear of being cut off, but from longing for reward:\n\n> “There is laid up for me the crown of righteousness…”  \n> — *2 Timothy 4:7–8*\n\nIn this light, maturity becomes central. The goal is not maintenance of salvation, but growth into fullness—so that we may receive a full reward (2 John 1:8) and not be ashamed at His coming (1 John 2:28).\n\n> “So that we may receive a full reward.”  \n> — *2 John 1:8*\n\n### C. Discipline and Forgiveness Still Matter\n\nSome will say: If I’m once saved, why does ongoing confession or repentance matter?\n\nBecause while salvation is secure, fellowship with the Father is relational. Sin breaks communion, not union.\n\n> “If we confess our sins, He is faithful… to forgive us.”\n> — *1 John 1:9*\n\n> “The Lord disciplines the one He loves.”\n> — *Hebrews 12:6*\n\n> “Confess your sins to one another… that you may be healed.”\n> — *James 5:16*\n\nDavid understood this matter. In Psalm 51, in his prayer of repentance, he asked not for the salvation to be restored unto him but for the joy of salvation to be restored to him.\n\n> \"Restore to me the gladness of Your salvation...\"\n> — *Psalm 51:12*\n\nSalvation cannot be lost, but forgiveness is ongoing, and discipline is real. The believer who walks in sin will experience loss of reward, diminished joy, and in some cases, even temporal judgment (1 Cor. 11:30).\n\n### D. Grace and Gravity\n\nThe doctrine of Kingdom reward threads the needle: it preserves the grace of eternal security while maintaining the gravity of Christian responsibility.\n\n- It refutes lawlessness: by showing that works still matter—not for salvation, but for reward.\n\n-  It removes fear: by grounding the believer’s identity in Christ, not in personal consistency.\n\n-  It honors maturity: making the goal of the Christian life not just endurance, but growth into fullness—a life that will be tested, evaluated, and rewarded.\n\nIn short: the believer who trusts in eternal security is not released from responsibility. He is freed from fear so that he can pursue Christ with greater purpose.\n\n> “Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering… and let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works.”\n> Hebrews 10:23–24\n\n### E. Summary\n\nIn summary, the doctrine presented here is more accurately described as dispensational reward and discipline. The purpose of this article is not to present a comprehensive biblical defense of the view—that may be the task of a future piece—but rather to offer a third framework that moves beyond the conventional security/insecurity dichotomy. This perspective aims to address both theological and pastoral concerns associated with eternal security, without dismissing the gravity of scriptural warnings.\n\nThe doctrine stands on the following affirmations:\n1.\tThe believer’s salvation is eternally secure, forming both the initiation and unshakable foundation of Christian life.\n2.\tThe believer’s conduct still matters, as they remain subject to God’s discipline in this age (cf. Heb. 12:6–11) and judgment in the next (cf. Rom. 14:10–12).\n3.\tThe believer’s works will be evaluated at the judgment seat of Christ (cf. 2 Cor. 5:10; Rom. 14:10), which will determine their reward and role in the age to come.\n4.\tThis coming age is the millennial kingdom, Christ’s 1000-year reign (cf. Rev. 20:4–6), often associated with the term kingdom of the heavens as it pertains to reward and participation.\n5.\tBelievers who mature—as evidenced by faithful living and fruitful works—will reign with Christ during this kingdom (cf. 2 Tim. 2:12; Rev. 3:21).\n6.\tBelievers who fail to mature will suffer loss (cf. 1 Cor. 3:15), which Scripture characterizes in metaphorical terms such as fire (1 Cor. 3:13–15), outer darkness (Matt. 25:30), and missing the wedding feast (Matt. 22:11–14)—not as a loss of eternal life, but of reward.\n7. All believers will enter into eternity after the kingdom age ends. The loss spoken of is age-specific, not eternal. Eternal life is the guaranteed inheritance of every believer, not subject to works or maturity.\n8.\tScriptures that appear to teach salvation by works or the loss of salvation are, in this framework, more accurately interpreted as referring to the believer’s reward or discipline, either in this age or the one to come.\n\n    Consider the following examples:\n\t- Matthew 7:21–23 – “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven.” These individuals clearly recognize Jesus as Lord and even minister in His name. Yet they are rejected—not as unbelievers, but as disqualified for kingdom participation because they “practice lawlessness.” The passage does not say they are eternally condemned, only that they are barred from entering the kingdom (i.e., millennial reign).\n\t- Matthew 24:45–51 – The servant who fails in his stewardship is “cut in pieces” and assigned a place with the hypocrites. Though this sounds severe, the text does not mention hell or final condemnation. It describes a servant—someone inside the household—receiving punishment, which fits the pattern of temporal discipline or exclusion from reward during the kingdom.\n\t- Revelation 2–3 – The letters to the churches repeatedly say, “to the one who overcomes…” and tie this to specific rewards: eating from the tree of life (2:7), not being hurt by the second death (2:11), authority over nations (2:26), sitting with Christ on His throne (3:21). The warning to “hold fast” so that no one takes your crown (3:11) suggests a loss—not of salvation, but of honor and reward in the kingdom age.\n\t- Hebrews 10:26–31 – This sobering passage describes fiery judgment for willful sin after knowing the truth. But again, it does not speak of eternal damnation. The emphasis is on severe punishment for believers who treat Christ’s sacrifice with contempt—consistent with temporal judgment or exclusion from kingdom privilege.\n\t- 1 Corinthians 3:13–15 – This text is especially clear: a believer’s work is tested by fire, and if it burns up, “he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.” The salvation of the person is secure, but what is lost is reward, suggesting a dispensational consequence without eternal jeopardy.\n\nWhile this doctrine does not directly answer the question of what some refer to as “future salvation,” it does suggest that salvation is organic—that is, a living process that unfolds over time. In this view, believers are not merely saved from judgment, but are being saved into the fullness of Christ, with maturity as a key marker of progress. This process is especially relevant to kingdom-related themes in the New Testament, where reward, inheritance, and participation in the age to come are connected to spiritual growth and faithful obedience. Thus, “salvation” is not a one-dimensional term, but a multifaceted reality encompassing past deliverance, present transformation, and future fulfillment. This organic and kingdom-oriented understanding of salvation deserves its own careful exploration.\n\nSome approach this question from the standpoint of assurance—asking, “How can I know I’m saved?” But assurance is a separate issue. It speaks to the believer’s confidence in God’s faithfulness, not necessarily the timing or outcome of every stage of salvation. Assurance is available in abundance, but it comes through spiritual growth, obedience, and intimacy with Christ—not by flattening all biblical warnings into theoretical impossibilities. That too deserves careful attention in its own right.\n\n\n## Conclusion: Security with Sobriety\n\n### A. Objection: Isn’t this still fear-based?\n\nSome who affirm eternal security will ask: “If you’re still warning believers of consequences—of loss, of rebuke, of discipline—aren’t you just replacing one fear with another?”\n\nIn part, the answer is yes. But not all fear is destructive. The problem isn’t fear—it’s what kind of fear and what consequence it’s tied to.\n\nScripture clearly teaches a reverent fear of the Lord, even for those eternally secure:\n\n> “Since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire.”\n> — *Hebrews 12:28–29*\n\nThe issue, then, is not the presence of fear, but the nature of the consequence. The Kingdom doctrine does not threaten believers with damnation, but with loss—loss of reward, joy, honor, and commendation. This is a sober reality. There is no way around God’s righteousness. Not all believers will hear “Well done.” And that ought to move us—not toward terror, but toward seriousness.\n\nSo yes, there is a fear—but it is the fear of accountability, not the fear of abandonment.\n\n### B. Objection: Isn’t this just purgatory?\n\nPurgatory is a catholic doctrine. The Catholic catechism is actually quite vague on the subject, maybe intentionally so. The most generous reading is that purgatory is some kind of temporal refinement before the final judgment. Exactly when, how long, or in what form? The catechism leaves that open.\n\nThat vague timing is about the only surface similarity with dispensational reward and discipline, both being temporary and before eternity. Though, technically, dispensational reward and discipline follows the judgment seat of Christ and is distinct from the great white throne judgment for unbelievers. The likeness is really incidental and mostly due to the catechism’s lack of clarity.\n\nThe real difference, and the main point of contention, is this: Catholic doctrine attaches purgatory to the practice of praying for the dead or contributing to the dead’s purification. As the catechism itself states:\n\n> “This teaching is also based on the practice of prayer for the dead…”\n\nThat’s something dispensational reward and discipline explicitly denies. Every believer’s reward or loss is based on their own life and living before God, nothing added by others after death.\n\nAt best, the only definitional overlap is that something happens after death and before eternity. But that’s far too thin, in my view, to call them anything alike.\n\n### C. Closing Word\n\nThis article has not attempted to solve every tension or answer every passage. The doctrine of salvation—its nature, assurance, fruit, and reward—has been the subject of centuries of careful study, debate, and prayer. I do not presume to close that conversation.\n\nWhat has been offered here is another way to hold the tension:\n\n- A way to uphold the security of salvation without falling into moral laxity.\n- A way to uphold moral seriousness without compromising the free grace of the gospel.\n- A way to see maturity as not just an ideal, but as the very path to Kingdom inheritance.\n\nI offer it not as a final word, but as a contribution. A perspective that may help the believer walk in assurance, grow toward maturity, and live with the joyful sobriety of one who will give an account—not to remain saved, but to receive what is promised.\n\n> “Look to yourselves, that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may win a full reward.”  — *2 John 1:8*\n\n## Related Works\n- Salvation by works or reward by works?\n- A defense on dispensional reward and discipline\n- Assurance: Am I saved?\n- Will be saved"
